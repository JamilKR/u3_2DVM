Suite of programs for calculations using the two-dimensional limit of
the Vibron Model (2DVM). Includes Minuit minimization program for
molecular bending modelling.

Programs

avec_U3_mh        :: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the model Hamiltonian using the cylindrical oscillator basis.

ipr_U3_mh         :: Inverse Participation Ratio for eigenvectors of the model Hamiltonian  using the cylindrical oscillator basis.

avec_U3_mh_SO3    :: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the model Hamiltonian using the displaced oscillator basis.

ipr_U3_mh_SO3     :: Inverse Participation Ratio for eigenvectors of the model Hamiltonian  using the displaced oscillator basis.

observables_U3_mh :: Perl script to launch the Fortran programs and compute the different observables in a range of control parameter values.

ipr_Husimi_U3_mh  :: Inverse Participation Ratio as the second momento of the Husimi distribution of the model Hamiltonian.



select_eigstate_components  :: Perl script to select a particular eigenstate components from an array of eigenstate components saved in a file.
